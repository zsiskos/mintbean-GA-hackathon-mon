## Mintbean / General Assembly Hackathon - Day 4 (Monday) - Portals

For this Hackathon, our objetive was to use [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/).

I had a coding/art project mulling about in my head and thought this was a great opportunity to build it. THe concept used portals to take the user to a diffferent place. On the landing page, teh user can see 4 portals taking them somewhere, and get a sneek peek of what they will see. I had to learn how to get 4 different animations working on the same page.

The first portal is one I created, eventually, I would like to have all the portals be something I created. Becasue of the 4-hour time limit, I used - with credit - other creations found in the exmaples pages of Paper.js.

Know issue:
In mobile mode, the 3rd and 4th portal do not click through. I'm working on figuring this out. For more details, check out the [Issues page](https://github.com/zsiskos/mintbean-GA-hackathon-mon/issues) of this repo.
